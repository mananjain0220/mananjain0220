# Welcome to My GitHub Space! 👋

I'm a Computer Science Master's student with a passion for AI, ML with a hint of SwiftUI(swift) code and the art of crafting impactful software. 🚀

## Current Role
As a Student Assistant at Cargoboard, I'm deeply involved in developing machine-learning solutions to tackle logistics damages. I leverage Python, along with tools like pandas, sci-kit-learn, and matplotlib in an agile environment.

## Thesis
My current academic adventure revolves around "A Multi-Modal ML Solution for Digital Freight Forwarding Operations," where I explore the fusion of image and tabular processing to push the boundaries of innovation.

## Skills & Expertise
- 💻 **Programming Languages:** Proficient in Python, with a focus on multi-modal AI, machine learning and data processing.
- 📊 **Tabular Data:** Experienced in working with tabular data, utilizing libraries like pandas for effective analysis.
- 📸 **Computer Vision:** Specializing in image processing and basic object recognition using Convolutional and Transformer-based networks.
- 🛠️ **Development Tools:** Well-versed in Git, IntelliJ, Xcode and VS Code for streamlined collaboration and code management.

## Side Project
Beyond academia, I dive into the world of iOS development with SwiftUI. Exploring the fusion of creativity and functionality in the mobile app space.

## Collaborate With Me
I'm actively seeking collaborations on machine learning projects. Whether it's enhancing algorithms or developing innovative solutions, let's create something remarkable together.

## UI/UX Learning Journey
I'm on a journey to master UI/UX development, experimenting with designs for projects like:

- [E-StoreMobile App](https://www.figma.com/proto/5IBNZaiM0WFbbdpXFrB0kP/E-StoreMobile-App-wireframe?node-id=27%3A20&scaling=scale-down&page-id=27%3A19&starting-point-node-id=27%3A20)
- [Weather App](https://www.figma.com/proto/jxhLV9V45UtNFL2MdSZCUT/Wether-app-protoype?node-id=1%3A3&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A3)
